# Purple+

Purple+ is a continuation of the following projects:

- [TwitchDB](https://github.com/distortednet/TwitchDB) by [distortednet](https://github.com/distortednet/).
- [/r/Twitch Twoos](https://github.com/Glyciant/SubredditPoints) by [me](https://github.com/Glyciant/).
- [/r/Twitch Advertisement Requests](https://github.com/Decicus/AdRequests) by [Decicus](https://github.com/Decicus).

As the Twitch API changed, TwitchDB slowly began to fall apart. After not too long, only a few features continued to work. It was decided that it needed to be completely rewritten from the ground up, and that it would be a good opportunity to combine the three projects together.

Purple+ now serves as a platform for everyone to be noticed - including people other than streamers. You can read more about it in the [Help Documentation](https://purple.plus/help).

## Beta

This beta is a complete rewrite of the system, bringing a variety of new features: Purple+ V2.0.
